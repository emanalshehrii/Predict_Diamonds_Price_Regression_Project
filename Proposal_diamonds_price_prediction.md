## Diamonds Price Prediction

### Overview

Diamonds belonge to a unique class of product, In this project, we are going to work on a dataset that consists of information about the diamond's price, and other aspects such as Clarity, etc. When we work on this data, we need to see which column is important for us and which is not. The main aim of the project is to make a model which can give us a good prediction of the price of the diamond based on other variables. We are going to use Linear Regression for this dataset and see if it gives us a good accuracy or not.

### Goals

- Which variables are significant in predicting the price of a diamonds
- Build a model to predict the diamonds price.
- Choose the model that give us the best predict. 


### Data Collection

In this project We will obtain our dataset for this study by scraping data from an online website that offers one of the largest collections of diamonds available for sale.
- Web scraping from website https://www.jamesallen.com/ 
- Sample size is 5000 rows and 10 features.

Target: Diamonds price

Features: 
- Shape: outline shape of the diamond
- Color: Diamond color 
- Clarity:is a measure of the purity and rarity of the stone 
- Cut:is a style or design guide used when shaping a diamond for polishing
- Carat: specific unit of measurement used to specify the weight of a diamond
- Length x Width: measured by the mm and it gives an idea of how big or small the stone will appear.
- Polish: Refers to the degree of smoothness of each facet of a diamond stone.
- Symmetry: refers to how well a diamond interacts with light and how brilliant a diamond is.
- Price: The original price.
